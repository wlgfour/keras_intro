A collection of basic implementations of tf.keras.
Contains a model for linear regression, a model to recognize images of volcanoes on venus and a model to predict
keypoints on images of faces. The datasets of volcanoes and facial keypoints were obtained on kaggle.com.
There are activation maps for an image fed through the model that trains on volcanoes and facial keypoints here
<a href="https://wlgfour.github.io/keras_intro/public/live_predictions.html">. There is also a link to a live 
predictions model for the facial keypoints.
